Implementing five sorting algorithms:

1. Oblivious: This sorting method does no sorting; it just reads and returns the numbers similar to the benchmark in Dr. Plank's notes. 

2. STL: This sorting method simply uses the std::sort function.

3. qsort: This sorting method simply uses the qsort function.

4. merge: This sorting method uses a custom implementation of the merge sort algorithm.

5. quick: This sorting method uses a custom implementation of the quick sort algorithm.
